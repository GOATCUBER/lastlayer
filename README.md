This is a website for fellow cubers. It gives you pictures of all the OLL and PLL algorithms of CFOP, as well as a timer to time yourself. 
To use the timer, hit the spacebar to start inspection, then start and stop the solve. The times are saved.
The "random" button will give you a random algorithm, and the hide name and algorithm buttons are for recognition practice.
